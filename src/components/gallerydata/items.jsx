Each small block of American Oak was carefully selected, aligned, and glued by hand to create this stunning patchwork-style tabletop. The rich, natural grain patterns give every inch of the surface a unique character, making this more than just a table — it’s a conversation starter and a statement of craftsmanship. Not only does it showcase the beauty and durability of American Oak, but it also reflects our commitment to sustainable practices — turning what would have been waste into something timeless.",
